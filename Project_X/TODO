Overview: [INCOMPLETE/IN-PROGRESS/COMPLETE] [Name]

Set up mouse event for flex sensor input data (win32 API side): [INCOMPLETE] [None]
- The flex sensor's data must also be sent. Think of suitable format, currently (X, Y). Could be
  (X, Y): 0 (for not click). 
- Output: resistance; degrees; analog value;
- led turns on if bent a certain angle (simulates a click)
- Mouse input func currently clicks once, want continual click
- 

Fix Arduino accelerometer code (Arduino side): [INCOMPLETE] [None]
- Understand what's happening with the arduino code
- Incorporate flex sensor code and send it along with accel values, e.g. (X, Y): 1 or (X, Y): 0
